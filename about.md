# About

### Me
Michael Nolan, graduate student and seattlite since 2019. I apply machine learning methods to computational neuroscience research. I'm primarily interested in dynamic network models motor function.

I'm currently co-advised by Professors [Amy Orsborn](http://faculty.washington.edu/aorsborn/) and [Eli Shlizerman](https://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Washington.
