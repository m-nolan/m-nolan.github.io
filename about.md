### Me
Michael Nolan, freelance data analyst and writer.

I was formerly a graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Washington. I was co-advised by Professors [Amy Orsborn](http://faculty.washington.edu/aorsborn/) and [Eli Shlizerman](https://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/).
