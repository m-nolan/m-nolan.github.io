### First things first
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Michael Nolan. I'm an electrical and computer engineering graduate student at the University of Washington. My current research work focuses on:
1. Developing and understanding unsupervised machine learning algorithms for time series data decoding
2. Using these systems and the insights derived therefrom to analyze neural signals data.

Prior to my current enrollment at UW, I worked as a research staff member with the biomedical systems and technologies group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

### Blog mission statement
I plan to use this platform to casually communicate my own research work and to summarize papers that I both find interesting and sufficiently understand. The latter of these two will most likely result from journal club meetings that I attend, so I intend to work the wonderful discussions and open questions from those meetings into each post.

I don't have a timeline for this, but I hope to have something of substance up soon.
